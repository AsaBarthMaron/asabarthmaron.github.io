Abstract: Gain control is a process that adjusts a system’s sensitivity when input levels change. Neural systems contain multiple mechanisms of gain control, but we do not understand why so many mechanisms are needed or how they interact. Here, we investigate these questions in the Drosophila antennal lobe, where we identify several types of inhibitory interneurons with specialized gain control functions. We find that some interneurons are nonspiking, with compartmentalized calcium signals, and they specialize in intra-glomerular gain control. Conversely, we find that other interneurons are recruited by strong and widespread network input; they specialize in global presynaptic gain control. Using computational modeling and optogenetic perturbations, we show how these mechanisms can work together to improve stimulus discrimination while also minimizing temporal distortions in network activity. Our results demonstrate how the robustness of neural network function can be increased by interactions among diverse and specialized mechanisms of gain control.
