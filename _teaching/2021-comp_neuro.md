What happens in our brains when we recall a memory? How does the composition of ion channels in a cell affect its function? How do millions of neurons interact to produce a process as complex as vision? This course will provide a broad overview of the burgeoning field of computational neuroscience, which tries to answer these questions, and how our brains work generally, by using theoretical modeling and data analysis techniques that draw on mathematics, physics, computer science, and more. Students will learn and practice both classical approaches and recent advancements through lectures, in-class activities, programming assignments, and a project. Topics covered include biophysical models of neurons, sensory processing, neural population dynamics, memory, deep and reinforcement learning, and techniques to analyze experimental data, among others. Basic programming experience (Python will be used) and familiarity with linear algebra at the level of Math 21b will be assumed, although there will be math review sections.
