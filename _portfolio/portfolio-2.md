Subpopulations of inhibitory neurons perform distinct computations and provide flexible coding across shifts in input statistics<br/><img src='/images/model_input_gain_response_gain.jpg' width='800'> <br/> Separate populations of inhibittory neurons perform input gain (left) and response gain (right). These populations are differentially recruited based on feature sparsity, and mutually inhibit one another. Therefore the network alters its normalization scheme based on input statistics.
