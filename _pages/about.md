I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Rachel Wilsonâ€™s lab at Harvard University, where I recently obtained my PhD. My research focused on how network architecture supports computations during sensory encoding. I am broadly interested in the intersection between neuroscience and machine learning, with particular interests in meta learning, abstract representation learning, attention, and reinforcement learning.
