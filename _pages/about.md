I am a PhD candidate in Neuroscience in [Rachel Wilsonâ€™s lab](https://wilson.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. My research focuses on how network architecture supports distinct computations during sensory encoding. I am broadly interested in the intersection between neuroscience and machine learning, with particular interests in meta learning, abstract representation learning, attention, and reinforcement learning.
